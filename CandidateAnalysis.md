# Candidate analysis #

Having generated the primer candidates we now need to analyse and evaluate the suitability of these candidates. Firstly, the forward and reverse primers are analysed in isolation and evaluated for:
  * Hairpin formation
  * Self dimerisation
  * Annealing temperature

We can do this using:
```
  myprimers.candidate_analysis();
```
