PD5 SSR application

pd5_ssr is an application for finding microsatellite regions and flanking primers in a file of FASTA-formatted nucleotide sequence data. The data is expected to be a set of short reads such as those produced by 454 sequencing, prior to sequence assembly. 

pd5_ssr takes one argument: the FASTA file of short reads.

pd5_ssr makes use of Sputnik by Chris Abajian (please see README_sputnik.txt for more details on how we've made use of Sputnik).
